Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This solution is a machine learning project that predicts possible diseases based on user-input symptoms using an ensemble of classification models. Built with `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `seaborn`, this solution combines Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Random Forest to deliver accurate and robust predictions from medical symptom data.


## 📌 Project Features

- 🧼 **Cleaned and Preprocessed Dataset:** Removed null values and encoded categorical variables using `LabelEncoder`.
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized disease distribution and assessed dataset balance.
- 🧠 **Multiple ML Models:** Trained SVM, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Random Forest classifiers.
- 🔁 **Cross-Validation:** Implemented 10-fold CV to validate model performance and reduce overfitting.
- 🧪 **Confusion Matrices:** Evaluated each model’s accuracy with detailed heatmaps.
- 🧬 **Ensemble Prediction:** Final diagnosis is generated by taking the statistical mode of predictions from all models.
- 💬 **Interactive Symptom Input:** Users can input symptoms (e.g., `Itching, Skin Rash`) to receive disease predictions in real-time.
